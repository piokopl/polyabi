Configuration file description:

market_key - ID of the market (event) on Plymarket whose token the bot will trade
pair_symbol - cryptocurrency pair (BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL)
trade_start - time the bot should start trading the given pair
trade_end - time the bot should stop trading the given pair
token_id - token ID
label - token name

How do I generate a pair entry? 
The easiest way is to use PolyNeko.io – in the Settings tab of the JSON Configuration Generator, 
paste the Polymarket event URL. Please note that the link should point to a specific entry from a 
given event, not a general event.
